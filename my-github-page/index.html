            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                The professional journey is just that—a journey. Where one starts isn't always where one ends. Along the way, we learn, grow, teach, and support others. A perpetual student, the curious mind never rests—always seeking what's next, reflecting on past lessons, and applying experience to the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With a background in Emergency Medicine, I transitioned from providing basic care to becoming a Cardiac Advanced EMT, delivering life-saving solutions in high-pressure situations. As a career Firefighter, I trained and worked with a team, always ready when the bell rings. Now, I own and operate a sustainable agriculture business, growing and selling produce while managing the facility, office, finances, marketing, and sales. Year after year, I’ve built a successful business, employed local community members, and fostered both economic and social productivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                As a business owner, I've worn many hats, adapting to the ever-changing landscape of entrepreneurship. I believe agriculture and technology should intersect productively, so I've written programs to streamline operations, learned to code, and built solutions to improve efficiency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inspired by problem-solving and innovation, I pursued Software Engineering to become a Full Stack Developer—creating applications that help others while continuously learning and growing in the field of technology. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, SQL, relational databases, and API REST development. I work well with frameworks like React, Bootstrap, Flask, Pygame, Angular, Marshmallow, and Spring. A lifelong learner, I’m excited to keep growing as a developer and see where this journey takes me next.
